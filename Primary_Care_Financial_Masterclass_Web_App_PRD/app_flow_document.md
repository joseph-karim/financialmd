# App Flow Document for the Primary Care Financial Masterclass App

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
When a new user first arrives at the Primary Care Financial Masterclass web app, they encounter a clean, modern landing page that reflects a professional, medical-themed aesthetic. The landing page showcases an enticing preview of the masterclass, including introductory modules that cover the objectives, agenda, and overview of physician reimbursement strategies. Non-logged-in visitors can freely explore these select sections to understand the value and style of the content. As the visitor becomes more interested in the masterclass, the app smoothly guides them towards the authentication process. The user is prompted to either sign in if they already have an account or create a new account. Account creation is straightforward, offering multiple signing up methods including using an email and password combination or through a magic link option provided by Supabase Auth. For users who forget their passwords, a simple and secure password recovery flow is available that helps reset their credentials, ensuring continued access without confusion. If users decide to sign out, the process is immediate, and they are returned to the landing page where they can still preview certain content sections.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
Once the user has logged in and, if applicable, made the one-time payment for full access, the main dashboard or home page becomes the central hub of the application. The home page is organized into a clear three-part layout with a sidebar navigation for module selection, a prominent main content area where the current module is displayed, and a collapsible header or toolbar that may include notifications and a help/chat button. The sidebar lists all modules of the masterclass in order, visually indicating which modules have been completed and which are pending. The header presents the applicationâ€™s branding and includes essential navigation elements to access other parts of the app such as the user profile, progress tracking dashboard, and settings. This central page not only serves as an entry point to the learning content but also makes clear how users can transition to additional features like interactive quizzes, AI-powered guidance and even administrative options in the future.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
During the learning journey, users transition smoothly through a series of interconnected pages and actions. After fully accessing the masterclass content, a user selects one of the modules from the sidebar. Upon selection, the main content area refreshes to display rich, modular content featuring tables, real-world examples, and detailed explanations of billing and coding principles. As the user scrolls through the content, a collapsible AI chat interface is permanently available in the corner of the screen, ready to offer contextual assistance and answer questions related to the current module. If a user encounters complex concepts such as RVU, MDM, or G-codes, they can ask the integrated AI chatbot for detailed explanations or real-life simulations. Additionally, when the module includes an interactive learning element such as a quiz or a simulation exercise, questions are presented on the same page with immediate feedback provided upon answering. The flow ensures that once a quiz is completed, the user is immediately directed to a summary of their performance and then allowed to progress to the next section. Navigation through the modules is intuitive since each module transition highlights the completed segments and the upcoming lessons in the sidebar, ensuring that every step is seamlessly connected from content consumption to quiz interaction and then back to further exploration in the masterclass.

## Settings and Account Management
Within the application, users have the ability to manage their personal information and access settings that affect their overall app experience. Once a user is logged in, they can navigate to an account settings page where they can update profile details including their email, password, and other personal preferences. This area also houses notification settings that allow the user to control how often and in what manner they receive updates or tips from the AI guidance system. For those who have made the one-time payment to unlock full access, the settings page provides information on their payment status and secure access to past invoices and receipts. After making any modifications in the settings, users can easily save their changes and return to the main dashboard with their updated preferences intact. This ensures that all configurations are synchronized with their profile and visible across different devices when they resume their learning experience.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
Throughout the application, several error states and alternative journeys have been carefully designed to keep users on track even when unexpected issues arise. If a user enters invalid data during the sign-up or sign-in processes, clear and friendly error messages guide them to correct the issues, such as reprompting for a valid email address or a stronger password. In scenarios where a user loses connectivity during an interactive session or while completing a payment, the application displays an informative fallback page that explains the situation and provides an option to retry the failed action. When the user attempts to access a restricted feature without proper authentication or without having upgraded to full access, the app notifies them of the restriction and succinctly explains how to unlock full access through the payment process. These error screens are designed to maintain clarity, reduce frustration, and offer a quick route back to the normal flow of content discovery and interactive learning. Every error or alternate journey is designed to be non-disruptive and to help the user return to the desired path with minimal confusion.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
The journey through the Primary Care Financial Masterclass App begins with a welcoming, professional landing page that captures the essence of the masterclass content and invites curiosity. The prospect of exploring valuable billing and coding strategies leads the user to a simple sign-up or sign-in process, after which they enter a well-structured dashboard that is both intuitive and comprehensive. The app weaves together several dynamic elements including modular content, interactive quizzes with immediate feedback, a responsive sidebar navigation, and an AI-powered chatbot that offers contextual support. The transition from a limited preview of content to a fully immersive learning experience after a one-time payment is seamless and well-integrated. Users also enjoy a robust settings page that enables them to manage their profile and communication preferences, all while making their progress available across multiple devices. Detailed error handling and fallback paths ensure that users remain engaged even if technical hurdles are encountered. Overall, this application transforms a static presentation into an engaging, interactive learning journey that empowers primary care physicians with the practical knowledge and tools required to optimize their coding and billing practices.
