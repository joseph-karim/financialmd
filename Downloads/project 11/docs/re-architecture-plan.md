# Primary Care Financial Masterclass - Re-Architecture Plan (v2.0)

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to transform the Primary Care Financial Masterclass from a static content delivery platform into an interactive toolkit and workflow assistant for US Primary Care Physicians (PCPs).

## Vision & Goals

**Vision:** To create an indispensable, interactive toolkit that empowers PCPs to optimize clinical workflows, improve documentation efficiency, ensure accurate billing and coding, and maximize legitimate revenue while maintaining compliance and reducing administrative burden.

**Goals:**
- Improve user engagement by shifting from passive content consumption to active tool usage
- Increase perceived value through tangible benefits (time savings, optimized billing, reduced admin friction)
- Enhance usability with an intuitive, workflow-centric interface
- Boost confidence by providing clear, actionable guidance and tools
- Address user feedback regarding content presentation, jargon, interactivity, and value proposition

## Target Audience

- **Primary:** US-based Primary Care Physicians (Family Medicine, Internal Medicine)
- **Secondary:** Nurse Practitioners (NPs) and Physician Assistants (PAs) in primary care, Office Managers, Medical Billers/Coders

## Key Features

1. **Workflow-Based Learning Modules:** Re-structured content focusing on common clinical scenarios
2. **Dynamic Data Integration:** Centralized database for CPT/G-codes, ICD-10, Modifiers, RVUs, and Glossary terms
3. **Interactive Tools:**
   - Code Lookup Tool
   - Scenario Calculators
   - Interactive Checklists
   - Modifier Helper Tools
4. **AI Documentation Assistants:**
   - AI Scribe Assist
   - Note Structurer
   - Billing Analysis & Feedback
5. **Supporting Resources:** Glossary, Central Toolbox, Enhanced Search
6. **User Account & Progress:** Authentication, payment integration, progress tracking

## Implementation Approach

The implementation will follow a phased approach:

1. **Foundation (Sprint 1-2):** Database setup, routing refactor, core components
2. **Core Modules & Tools (Sprint 3-5):** First workflow modules, interactive tools
3. **Advanced Content & AI MVP (Sprint 6-7):** Remaining modules, AI tools integration
4. **Refinement & Testing (Ongoing):** User testing, feedback incorporation, optimization

## Project Structure

The project will maintain the existing tech stack (React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Supabase) while introducing new components, database structures, and AI capabilities to create a more engaging and valuable user experience.
