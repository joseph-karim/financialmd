# Tech Stack Document

This document explains the technology choices for the Primary Care Financial Masterclass App in simple terms. It outlines how different pieces of technology work together to provide an engaging and secure learning platform for primary care physicians.

## Frontend Technologies

Our frontend is responsible for the parts of the app that users interact with directly. Here’s what we are using and why:

- **Vite js**: Acts as our fast development server and build tool. It makes the process of creating and testing the app quick and efficient.
- **React**: This is the backbone of our user interface. React allows us to build reusable components so that our interface feels modern, interactive, and consistent.
- **TypeScript**: TypeScript adds helpful checks to our JavaScript code, reducing bugs and improving maintainability. It’s especially useful for keeping our code robust as the application grows.
- **Tailwind CSS**: With Tailwind CSS, we quickly style our app using pre-built classes. This helps us create the clean, medical-themed look with light colors and clear typography.
- **Shadcn UI**: Integrated into our design for building beautiful, ready-to-use UI components that are consistent with our overall aesthetic.
- **Zustand**: A state management library that ensures the app responds quickly to user actions (like navigating modules or interacting with quizzes) by keeping track of the app’s data in a simple and efficient way.

These choices ensure that the user interface is both appealing and functional while speeding up development time.

## Backend Technologies

Our backend powers the functionality behind the scenes, handling data, user accounts, payments, and AI-driven guidance. The major components include:

- **Supabase**: Serving as our all-in-one backend service. It handles:
  - **PostgreSQL Database**: Storing user data, progress tracking, and the masterclass content safely and reliably.
  - **Supabase Auth**: Managing user registration and login with secure methods like email/password or magic links.
  - **Supabase Edge Functions**: Executing server-side scripts, including integration points for our AI functionalities.
- **OpenAI API**: Provides our AI-powered chatbot which offers real-time, contextual assistance based on the masterclass content. This ensures that users can get immediate help with complex billing and coding topics.
- **Stripe**: Integrated for processing one-time payments. This allows users to seamlessly transition from a free preview to full access by unlocking all modules through secure transactions.

These backend choices work together to ensure that all data is managed securely and that the operations behind the user experience are smooth and responsive.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

To make sure the app is reliable, scalable, and easy to deploy, we have picked the following tools and services:

- **Netlify**: Our hosting platform. Netlify provides robust hosting, built-in email and analytics, and an easy deployment process that makes updates seamless.
- **Version Control (Git and GitHub)**: For managing our code, tracking changes, and collaborating efficiently, ensuring that any updates or fixes can be rolled out quickly.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Although not explicitly detailed, our workflow utilizes continuous integration and continuous deployment practices to automatically test and deploy changes, ensuring the app remains stable as we add new features.

This infrastructure ensures the app is always available, performs well, and can grow with additional features in the future.

## Third-Party Integrations

Our project integrates with several external services which enhance its functionality without complicating the core development:

- **Stripe**: Provides a secure and easy way to handle payments so that users can unlock full access with a one-time transaction.
- **OpenAI API**: Powers the AI chatbot, ensuring that help and guidance related to the presentation content are available in real time.
- **Netlify Analytics and Email Services**: These built-in features help track user engagement and provide communication tools without needing a third-party add-on.

These integrations enhance overall functionality and user trust by leveraging established services.

## Security and Performance Considerations

Keeping user data safe and ensuring a smooth app experience is our top priority. Here’s how we address security and performance:

- **User Authentication**: Using Supabase Auth, we ensure that login and registration are secure, with methods like magic links reducing risks associated with weak passwords.
- **Secure Payments with Stripe**: All transactions are processed through trusted, secure payment channels, protecting users' financial information.
- **Data Protection**: Data in PostgreSQL is securely managed, with backups and best practices in place to protect sensitive user information.
- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - Fast builds and hot reloading via Vite ensure that development and user interactions are snappy.
  - Efficient state management with Zustand helps maintain smooth transitions and real-time tracking of progress.
  - Responsive design elements ensure the app works equally well on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

These measures make sure that the app is both secure and efficient, providing users with a reliable learning experience.

## Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary

To recap, our tech stack is designed to transform a static presentation into an engaging, interactive, and secure learning environment. Our key choices include:

- **Frontend**: Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, and Zustand – ensuring a fast, modern, and user-friendly interface.
