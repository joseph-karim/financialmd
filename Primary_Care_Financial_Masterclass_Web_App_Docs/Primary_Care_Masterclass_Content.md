## PHYSICIAN REIMBURSEMENT

* Per American Academy of Family Medicine (AAFP), average reported full-time family physician total compensation in 2022 was $274,359 (Only 7000 respondents out of 100,000+ primary care doctors) (range of $120,000 - $1.6 million)[cite: 15].
* Total compensation is derived from combination of base salary, productivity (RVUs), quality performance, value-based payments and other non-RVU incentives such panel size, after hours service, meetings and mid-level supervision (NP/PA)[cite: 16].
* Depending on the organization, combination of the above will determine final total pay, although total RVUs generated usually accounts for highest percentage of total compensation[cite: 17].
* Physician in private practice or direct primary care (DPC) can be paid on collections generated and subtracting total expenses[cite: 18].
* Other organizations reimburse based on salary, years of experience and quality metrics and do not rely on RVUs[cite: 19].
* The most important factor is the rate paid per RVU; this is a very well-kept secret of most health organizations, usually last information disclosed before signing a contract[cite: 20].
* Most large organizations rely on MGMA reports or other benchmarking reports to determine the "fair market value" to pay per RVU[cite: 21].
* The hospital-owned medical groups or affiliated physician practices can contribute data to the MGMA's research and benchmarking efforts, which doctors do not have access to readily although can be purchased for a fee[cite: 22].
* The rate paid per RVU significantly determines your pay and can vary widely between health organizations even within the same city as much as 30%[cite: 23]. There can also be tier levels based on productivity[cite: 24].
* National average for Family Medicine outpatient is around $45 per RVU[cite: 24]. This can vary significantly and be as low as $24 per RVU (Indiana University Health) upwards of $80 per RVU (Signature Health Massachusetts)[cite: 25].

## PHYSICIAN REIMBURSEMENT (Continued)

* CPT codes are the most common way to bill for the work done in the outpatient setting in the United States[cite: 26]. Consists of billing codes 99*** in addition to procedure and modifier codes[cite: 27].
* Each code has an assigned RVU value, when multiplied by the RVU rate determines your reimbursement for that service rendered[cite: 28].
* Most primary care doctors are familiar with the basic billing codes[cite: 29]. There are many additional codes that should be captured more frequently to better reflect the work being doing and ultimately increase pay[cite: 30].
* Coding is taught poorly in most residency programs, ACGME requirements for this is very minimal[cite: 31]. Most experience is attained in the outpatient setting and can vary depending on the savviness of the faculty[cite: 32].
* Most physicians who work for large health care organization are largely seen as referral sources for their specialists[cite: 33]. Most organizations are not incentivized to teach billing and coding well to maximize reimbursement for primary care doctors[cite: 34].
* Despite having a billing and coding department, often just provided a list of codes although never instructed on full integration potential into practice[cite: 35].
* Higher reimbursement, regardless of being an employed physician through an organization or in private practice, requires better productivity achieved through improved coding[cite: 36].

---
## PHYSICIAN REIMBURSEMENT (Goal)

* To earn $400,000 yearly based on national average of rate of $45 per RVU would require to generate 8890 RVUs during the year[cite: 37].
* Most outpatient doctors work on average of 46 weeks of the year spending around 36h of patient contact hours per week[cite: 38].
* Doing the math indicates you would need to generate approximately 193 RVUs per week or 5.4 RVUs per hour worked seeing patients[cite: 39].
* Is it more optimal to bill based on Time or Complexity to achieve this target? [cite: 40]

## REVIEW OF CODING

### BILLING BASED ON TIME

**Table 1: CPT Codes and Time Requirements** [cite: 43]
| New Patient CPT Codes | Time Must be Met or Exceeded | Establish Patient CPT Codes | Time Must be Met or Exceeded |
|---|---|---|---|
| 99202 | 15-29 Minutes | 99212 | 10-19 Minutes |
| 99203 | 30-44 Minutes | 99213 | 20-29 Minutes |
| 99204 | 45-59 Minutes | 99214 | 30-39 Minutes |
| 99205 | 60-74 Minutes | 99215 | 40-59 Minutes |

**Table 2: CPT Codes and Work RVU (Example Values)** [cite: 44]
| New Patient CPT Codes | Work RVU | Establish Patient CPT Codes | Work RVU |
|---|---|---|---|
| 99202 | 0.93 | 99212 | 0.7 |
| 99203 | 1.6 | 99213 | 1.3 |
| 99204 | 2.6 | 99214 | 1.92 |
| 99205 | 3.5 | 99215 | 2.8 |

**Table 3: Comparison of Work RVUs (2020 vs 2021 Updates)** [cite: 47]
| New Patient CPT Codes | Work RVU 2020 | Updated Work RVU 2021 | Establish Patient CPT Codes | Work RVU 2020 | Updated Work RVU 2021 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 99202 | 0.93 | 0.93 | 99212 | 0.48 | 0.7 |
| 99203 | 1.42 | 1.6 | 99213 | 0.97 | 1.3 |
| 99204 | 2.43 | 2.6 | 99214 | 1.5 | 1.92 |
| 99205 | 3.17 | 3.5 | 99215 | 2.11 | 2.8 |

* All work RVUs for annual exams have remained the same[cite: 48].
* Medicare wellness exams along with TCM visits also received work RVU increases[cite: 49].
* Some organizations may have adjusted conversion factor rate paid per RVU if they have adopted this new scale in order to maintain budget neutrality[cite: 50].
* Some codes did not receive any wRVU increases such as 99202[cite: 51]. New patient visits 99203-99205 received slight increase in wRVU[cite: 51].
* The largest increases were for established patients 99212-99215 which received upwards of 28-45% increase in wRVU[cite: 52].

### BILLING BASED ON TIME (Limitations)

* Billing strictly based on time limits RVUs per hour earning potential and ultimately fails to reach threshold of 5.4 RVUs per hour[cite: 53].
* Examples:
    * 15 min x 4 = 99212 (0.70 RVU) x 4 = 2.80 RVUs total
    * 20 min x 3 = 99213 (1.3 RVU) x 3 = 3.90 RVUs total
    * 30 min x 2 = 99214 (1.92 RVU) x 2 = 3.84 RVUs total
    * 30 min + 15 min + 15 min = 99214 (1.92 RVU) + 99212 (0.70 RVU) x 2 = 3.32 RVUs total
    * 40 min + 20 min = 99215 (2.8 RVU) + 99213 (1.3 RVU) = 4.10 RVUs total
    * 40 min (New) + 20 min (Established) = 99203 (1.6 RVU) + 99213 (1.3 RVU) = 2.90 RVUs total
    * 45 min (New) + 15 min (Established) = 99204 (2.6 RVU) + 99212 (0.7 RVU) = 3.3 RVUs total
    * 30 min (New) + 30 min (New) = 99203 (1.6 RVU) + 99203 (1.6 RVU) = 3.2 RVUs total
    * 60 min (New) = 99205 (3.5 RVU) = 3.50 RVUs total [cite: 53]
* Can be helpful to bill based on time if doing pre-chart review along with completing charts after visit if leads to higher level billing (total time spent on patient care including pre-charting, patient encounter and post visit wrap-up required all on same day)[cite: 53].
* If a scheduled visit ran over the allotted time, despite being low complexity may yield higher level codes if billing based on time[cite: 54].
* In most cases, it is preferable to bill based on complexity and visit type to achieve the target hourly productivity[cite: 55].

## BILLING BASED ON COMPLEXITY

**Table 4: Elements of Medical Decision Making (MDM)** [cite: 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67]

| Code | Level of MDM (Based on 2 out of 3 Elements) | Number and Complexity of Problems Addressed | Amount and/or Complexity of Data to be Reviewed and Analyzed | Risk of Complications and/or Morbidity or Mortality of Patient Management |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 99211 | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| 99202 / 99212 | Straightforward | **Minimal:** 1 self-limited or minor problem | **Minimal or none** | **Minimal risk** |
| 99203 / 99213 | Low | **Low:** 2+ self-limited/minor problems; OR 1 stable chronic illness; OR 1 acute, uncomplicated illness/injury | **Limited:** (Must meet reqs of at least 1 of 2 categories) **Cat 1:** Tests/documents (Any combination of 2 from: Review prior external note; Review unique test result; Order unique test) **Cat 2:** Assessment requiring independent historian | **Low risk** |
| 99204 / 99214 | Moderate | **Moderate:** 1+ chronic illness w/ exacerbation/progression/side effects; OR 2+ stable chronic illnesses; OR 1 undiagnosed new problem w/ uncertain prognosis; OR 1 acute illness w/ systemic symptoms; OR 1 acute complicated injury | **Moderate:** (Must meet reqs of at least 1 of 3 categories) **Cat 1:** Tests/docs/historian (Any combination of 3 from: Review prior external note; Review unique test result; Order unique test; Assess. requiring independent historian) **Cat 2:** Independent interpretation of test **Cat 3:** Discussion of management/test interpretation w/ external provider | **Moderate risk:** Examples: Prescription drug mgmt; Decision re: minor surgery w/ risk factors; Decision re: elective major surgery w/o risk factors; Dx/Tx limited by social determinants |
| 99205 / 99215 | High | **High:** 1+ chronic illness w/ severe exacerbation/progression/side effects; OR 1 acute/chronic illness/injury posing threat to life/bodily function | **Extensive:** (Must meet reqs of at least 2 of 3 categories) **Cat 1:** Tests/docs/historian (Any combination of 3 from: Review prior external note; Review unique test result; Order unique test; Assess. requiring independent historian) **Cat 2:** Independent interpretation of test **Cat 3:** Discussion of management/test interpretation w/ external provider | **High risk:** Examples: Drug therapy requiring intensive toxicity monitoring; Decision re: elective major surgery w/ risk factors; Decision re: emergency major surgery; Decision re: hospitalization; Decision not to resuscitate/de-escalate care |

---
### THE LEVEL 3 VISIT (99203 / 99213) [cite: 68, 69, 70]

* **Complexity:** Low
* **Problems:** 2+ self-limited/minor problems; OR 1 stable chronic illness; OR 1 acute, uncomplicated illness/injury[cite: 69].
* **Data:** Limited (Meet 1 of 2 categories: Cat 1 - Combo of 2 tests/docs review/order; Cat 2 - Independent historian)[cite: 70].
* **Risk:** Low risk from additional testing/treatment.
* **Examples:** 2 minor problems managed conservatively; 1 stable chronic problem on meds; 1 new problem needing OTC treatment[cite: 71].
* **Documentation:** HPI (brief OK), Pertinent PE only (ROS not needed), Plan with recommended treatments[cite: 71].
* **Strategy:** Minimize using this code; most primary care visits involve multiple problems and prescriptions[cite: 72].

---
### THE LEVEL 4 VISIT (99204 / 99214) [cite: 73, 74, 75, 76]

* **Complexity:** Moderate
* **Problems:** 1+ chronic illness w/ exacerbation/progression/side effects; OR 2+ stable chronic illnesses; OR 1 undiagnosed new problem w/ uncertain prognosis; OR 1 acute illness w/ systemic symptoms; OR 1 acute complicated injury[cite: 74, 75].
* **Data:** Moderate (Meet 1 of 3 categories: Cat 1 - Combo of 3 tests/docs/historian; Cat 2 - Independent test interpretation; Cat 3 - Discussion w/ external provider)[cite: 76].
* **Risk:** Moderate risk from additional testing/treatment. Examples: Prescription drug management, decision re: minor surgery w/ risk factors, decision re: elective major surgery w/o risk factors, dx/tx limited by social determinants[cite: 77].
* **Examples:** 1 chronic problem needing med adjustment; 2 stable chronic problems on meds; 1 new problem needing prescription management[cite: 77].
* **Documentation:** HPI (brief OK), Pertinent PE only (ROS not needed), Plan with prescribed meds/treatments[cite: 78].
* **Strategy:**
    1.  Incorporate prescription meds to shift from level 3 to level 4[cite: 78].
    2.  Limit chronic problems to 2-3 per visit (more won't yield higher code)[cite: 79].
* The increase from Level 3 (1.3 RVU) to Level 4 (1.92 RVU) is over 47% and accounts for most outpatient visits[cite: 80].

**Table 5: Common Level 4 Scenarios (Systemic Involvement + Prescription)** [cite: 81, 82]
| Condition | Prescription Treatment | Systemic Involvement |
|---|---|---|
| Viral Illness (COVID, Flu, Herpes, Shingles) | Paxlovid, Tamiflu, Valacyclovir, Tessalon Pearls, Rx cough syrups, Steroids | Fever, Chills, Cough, Myalgias, Headache, Painful Lesions |
| Bacterial Infection (Sinusitis, Bronchitis, OM, Strep, Cellulitis, UTI, STD) | Antibiotics (various classes), Tessalon Pearls, Rx cough syrups, Steroids | Fever, Chills, CVA pain, Lesions, Cough, Myalgias, Dysuria |
| Migraines/Headaches | Toradol injection, Rx NSAIDs, Imitrex | Visual/Auditory aura, Sensitivities |
| Musculoskeletal Injuries (LBP, Knee pain, Strains/sprains) | Rx NSAIDs, Muscle Relaxers, Steroid pak, Lidocaine patches | Neuropathy, Radiculopathy, Joint swelling, Inflammation |

---
### THE LEVEL 5 VISIT (99205 / 99215) [cite: 84, 85, 86]

* **Complexity:** High
* **Problems:** 1+ chronic illness w/ severe exacerbation/progression/side effects; OR 1 acute/chronic illness/injury posing threat to life/bodily function[cite: 85].
* **Data:** Extensive (Meet 2 of 3 categories: Cat 1 - Combo of 3 tests/docs/historian; Cat 2 - Independent test interpretation; Cat 3 - Discussion w/ external provider)[cite: 86].
* **Risk:** High risk from additional testing/treatment. Examples: Drug therapy needing intensive toxicity monitoring, decision re: elective major surgery w/ risk factors, decision re: emergency major surgery, decision re: hospitalization, decision not to resuscitate/de-escalate care[cite: 87].
* **Examples:** Sending patients to ER/hospital; Patients with high-risk conditions (cancer, risk of death/harm); Patients on high-risk meds needing monitoring; Non-compliance posing risk to health[cite: 87].
* **Documentation:** HPI (brief OK), Pertinent PE only (ROS not needed), Plan MUST discuss risks[cite: 88].
* **Strategy:** Identify these common but often under-coded patients[cite: 89].

**Table 6: Examples Qualifying for Level 5 Visit** [cite: 91]
| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| Hospital/ER Evaluation (Urgent workup/stabilization needed) | Concerns for STEMI, A.fib, Arrhythmia, PE, DVT, Sepsis, Syncope, Seizure, CHF/COPD exacerbation, Hypotension, Stroke, Hypertensive emergency, DKA, Appendicitis, SBO, Acute Renal Failure, Anemia |
| High Risk Medical Conditions (Risk of death/bodily harm requiring intervention) | Unstable Angina needing stress test; 3-vessel CAD needing CABG; New colon mass concerning for cancer; Breast cancer pt undergoing chemo/radiation; Ongoing drug/alcohol abuse, risky behaviors |
| High Risk Medications (Require close monitoring for adverse events) | Combo of opioids/benzos/sleep meds; Active chemotherapy/cancer treatments; Multiple mood stabilizers/anticonvulsants (Lithium, Lamictal, Phenytoin, etc.) |
| Non-compliance with Treatment (Risk of exacerbation/hospitalization) | Excessive alcohol despite esophageal varices/cirrhosis; Uncontrolled diabetes risking DKA; Uncontrolled BP risking stroke |

**Level 5 Documentation Examples:**
* **Example 1 (ER Referral):** Patient with exertional chest pain, respiratory distress, exam findings suggestive of DVT/PE/MI/CHF/COPD/ARF. Discussed need for urgent ER eval, patient agrees to go with family[cite: 94].
* **Example 2 (High-Risk Meds):** Patient on chronic Xanax + Norco. Discussed FDA black box warning re: serious risks (dizziness, sleepiness, slowed breathing, coma, death) of combining opioids and CNS depressants. Patient aware[cite: 95].
* **Example 3 (Non-Compliance):** Patient drinks 3-4 alcohol/day despite hx of varices/cirrhosis. Discussed risks (bleeding, ascites, life-threatening complications). Provided resources, patient refuses help currently[cite: 96].

## ANNUAL EXAMS

**Table 7: Annual Exam CPT Codes and wRVUs** [cite: 99]
| Ages | New Patient CPT Code | wRVU | Established Patient CPT Code | wRVU |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Infant (<1 yr) | 99381 | 1.5 | 99391 | 1.37 |
| Early Childhood (1-4 yrs) | 99382 | 1.6 | 99392 | 1.5 |
| Late Childhood (5-11 yrs) | 99383 | 1.7 | 99393 | 1.5 |
| Adolescent (12-17 yrs) | 99384 | 2.00 | 99394 | 1.7 |
| Young Adult (18-39 yrs) | 99385 | 1.92 | 99395 | 1.75 |
| Adult (40-64 yrs) | 99386 | 2.33 | 99396 | 1.9 |
| Elderly (65+) | 99387* | 2.5 | 99397* | 2.0 |

* wRVU for physical exams has remained the same despite 2021 increases for other E&M codes[cite: 100].
* Elderly codes (65+) rarely used; Medicare Wellness Exams (different codes/wRVU) are typical[cite: 101].

**Table 8: Annual Exam Billing Strategy** [cite: 104]
| Total Time Spent on Visit | Billing Code Strategy |
|---|---|
| 15 to 20 mins | 9939* |
| 30 to 40 mins | 9939* + 99213/99214/99215 (with 25 modifier) |

* **Strategy:** Addressing chronic problems during annual visit is a separate charge (split-bill)[cite: 105]. Annual exams cover screenings, immunizations, counseling[cite: 105]. Need split-bill if addressing conditions like HTN, DM, Anxiety, etc.[cite: 106].
* **Documentation:** Use EMR templates for efficiency[cite: 107]. Need comprehensive PE, review screenings/immunizations, pertinent counseling[cite: 107].
* **Remember:** Most insurances cover annual exams yearly; split-bill results in a regular office visit charge for the patient[cite: 108]. Need a billing code for every 15-20 mins to meet the 5.4 RVU/hour target[cite: 109].

**Annual Exam Billing Examples:**
* **Example 1 (Simple Annual):** 35yo M, no PMH, UTD immunizations, requests routine labs. Dx: Annual Physical Exam, Multiphasic Screening. Orders: CBC, CMP, A1C, Lipid Panel. Billing: 99395 (1.75 RVU)[cite: 111, 112, 113, 114].
* **Example 2 (Annual + Chronic):** 62yo F for annual and 6mo f/u (DM2, HTN, HLD). Due for flu shot, labs, mammogram. UTD colon/cervical screening. Dx: Annual Exam, Ess. HTN, DM2 w/o Insulin, HLD, Breast Ca Screen, Need Flu Vaccine. Orders: CBC, CMP, A1C, Lipid, Microalbumin, Flu shot, Mammogram. Billing: 99396 + 25 modifier + 99214 (1.9 RVU + 1.92 RVU = 3.82 RVUs)[cite: 115, 116, 117].

---
## NEW PATIENT VISIT

* **Strategy:** For non-Medicare new patients, try completing the annual exam concurrently[cite: 118]. New patient visits are usually longer, allowing time for screenings/immunizations[cite: 119]. Insurance covers annuals yearly, split-bill yields a regular office visit charge[cite: 120]. Only one new patient code per first encounter[cite: 121].
* **Example RVU Calculations (Split-Bill New Patient + Annual):**
    * **Young Adult (18-39):**
        * New Level 3 (99203) + Annual (99395) = 1.6 + 1.75 = 3.35 RVUs
        * New Annual (99385) + Est. Level 3 (99213) = 1.92 + 1.3 = 3.22 RVUs
        * New Level 4 (99204) + Annual (99395) = 2.6 + 1.75 = 4.35 RVUs
        * New Annual (99385) + Est. Level 4 (99214) = 1.92 + 1.92 = 3.84 RVUs
        * New Level 5 (99205) + Annual (99395) = 3.5 + 1.75 = 5.25 RVUs
        * New Annual (99385) + Est. Level 5 (99215) = 1.92 + 2.80 = 4.72 RVUs [cite: 122]
    * **Adult (40-64):**
        * New Level 3 (99203) + Annual (99396) = 1.6 + 1.9 = 3.50 RVUs
        * New Annual (99386) + Est. Level 3 (99213) = 2.33 + 1.3 = 3.63 RVUs
        * New Level 4 (99204) + Annual (99396) = 2.6 + 1.9 = 4.50 RVUs
        * New Annual (99386) + Est. Level 4 (99214) = 2.33 + 1.92 = 4.25 RVUs
        * New Level 5 (99205) + Annual (99396) = 3.5 + 1.9 = 5.4 RVUs
        * New Annual (99386) + Est. Level 5 (99215) = 2.33 + 2.8 = 5.13 RVUs [cite: 123]
* **Maximizing Productivity:** Bill new patient E&M code primary + established yearly physical for highest wRVU in most cases[cite: 124]. Split visits can potentially yield the target 5.4 RVU/hour[cite: 125].

**New Patient Visit Example (Split-Bill):**
* 52yo M establishing care. PMH: Hypothyroidism, HTN, HLD[cite: 126]. Recently moved[cite: 127]. Takes meds (Lisinopril, Levo, Atorva) without issue[cite: 128]. Sx Hx: Appy, Tonsils[cite: 129]. SHx: No smoke/ETOH/drugs; Father (DM, HTN), Mother (Hypothyroid); Mixed diet, multivitamin; Bikes 3x/wk, stretches; Sleeps 7-8h; New dentist; Eye check yearly (readers only); Accountant[cite: 130, 131, 132, 133, 134]. Wants labs (almost 1 yr)[cite: 135]. Never screened for colon cancer[cite: 136]. UTD immunizations, gets flu shot yearly[cite: 137].
* Dx: Establish Care, Primary HTN, Hypothyroid, HLD, Annual Exam, DM Screen, Colon Ca Screen[cite: 138].
* Orders: CBC, CMP, A1C, Lipid, TSH, FT4, Cologuard[cite: 138].
* Billing: 99204 + 25 modifier + 99396 (2.6 RVU + 1.9 RVU = 4.5 RVUs)[cite: 138].

## COMMONLY MISSED CODES

### Tobacco Use Cessation Counselling
* **99406:** 3 - 10 mins (0.24 RVU) [cite: 139]
* **99407:** > 10 mins (0.50 RVU) [cite: 139]
* **Documentation:** Add to any visit (incl. wellness). Must doc time spent. Example: "Smoking risks (COPD, cancer, heart dz) discussed. Strategies (NRT, BHT, meds) counseled. Total time: 3 mins"[cite: 140].
* **Strategy:** Identify tobacco users, use smart phrase for quick doc[cite: 141].

### Preventative Medicine Counselling or Risk Factor Reduction
* **99401:** Approx 15 mins (0.48 RVU) [cite: 141]
* **Documentation:** Add ONLY to office visits (not wellness/annual). Must doc time spent (need >50% of time, ~8 mins, but enforcement varies)[cite: 142].
* **Strategy:** Identify pts in social history, use smart phrase[cite: 143].

**Table 9: ICD-10 Codes for Preventative Counseling (99401)** [cite: 146]
| ICD 10 Code | Description |
|---|---|
| F10.10 | Alcohol abuse, uncomplicated |
| F11.10 | Opioid abuse, uncomplicated |
| F12.10 | Cannabis abuse, uncomplicated |
| F13.10 | Sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic abuse, uncomplicated |
| F15.90 | Other stimulant use, unspecified, uncomplicated |
| F16.90 | Hallucinogen use, unspecified, uncomplicated |
| Z91.89 | Other specified personal risk factors, NEC |
| E66.9 | Obesity, unspecified (***only for non-Medicare patients***) |

* Need ~8 mins counseling on listed conditions for 99401[cite: 147]. Longer codes (99402-4) exist but aren't efficient[cite: 148]. Medicare has separate obesity code[cite: 149].

**Preventative Counseling Documentation Examples:**
* **Alcohol:** "Pt drinks 3-4/day. Excessive. Alcohol=carcinogen (6 cancers). No safe limit (WHO). Links to early dementia. Counseled reduction, resources provided. ~8 mins"[cite: 150].
* **Obesity:** "BMI 33. Discussed diet/exercise for BMI <25. Exercise 150 min/wk (inc HR/sweat), strength 2x/wk. Less sitting. Portion control, <1500 cal. Total plan/counseling time: ~8 mins"[cite: 151].
* **Vaping:** "E-cigs contain nicotine, chemicals, toxicants (anti-freeze, carcinogens). Youth vulnerable (brain dev - CDC)[cite: 152]. Not approved for cessation, long-term effects unknown[cite: 153]. Liquid causes nicotine poisoning (vomiting, sweat, dizzy, inc HR, lethargy, seizure, dyspnea)[cite: 154, 155]. Assoc w/ popcorn lung/lipid pneumonia. Total counseling time ~8 mins"[cite: 156].
* **Marijuana:** "Risks: anxiety, fear, panic instead of relaxation (esp w/ high dose/potency, inexperience). Large doses -> acute psychosis (hallucinations, delusions, lost identity). Distinct from longer psychotic disorders assoc. w/ use in vulnerable ppl. Recent ACC studies: 34% higher CAD risk, 20% inc MI risk, 40% inc stroke risk vs non-users[cite: 157, 158]. Approx counseling time: 8 mins"[cite: 158].
* **AAFP Position on Marijuana:** Opposes recreational use[cite: 159]. Supports decriminalization of personal possession[cite: 159]. Recognizes benefits of intervention/treatment over incarceration[cite: 160]. Provide counseling regardless of state laws, follow AAFP guidelines to maximize productivity[cite: 160].

**Preventative Counseling Billing Examples:**
* **Example 1 (Anxiety/Depression + Substance Use):** 24yo F f/u Sertraline 50mg. Good control[cite: 161, 162, 163]. Smokes 0.5 PPD (down from 1 PPD)[cite: 164]. Uses marijuana 3x/wk recreationally[cite: 165]. Counseled smoking cessation (3 min) + marijuana use (8 min)[cite: 166]. Dx: Depression, GAD, Nicotine Dep., Cannabis Abuse[cite: 167]. Billing: 99214 + 25 modifier + 99406 + 99401 (1.92 + 0.24 + 0.48 = 2.64 RVUs)[cite: 167].
* **Example 2 (HTN/HLD + Obesity):** 44yo M f/u Amlodipine 5mg, Pravastatin 20mg. No SE[cite: 168, 169]. BP < 130/80 at home[cite: 169]. Lost 10 lbs, BMI still 41[cite: 170].

## OFFICE PROCEDURES

* Many office procedures can increase total wRVU[cite: 172]. Some quick, others take time[cite: 173].
* **Top 4 High-Return, Minimal Prep Procedures:** [cite: 174]
    1.  **69210:** Cerumen Disimpaction Unilateral Manually (0.61 RVU)
        * Medicare pays for one manual debridement/visit; others may reduce 2nd ear RVU.
    2.  **17110:** Wart Destruction 1-14 Lesions (Cryo) (0.70 RVU)
    3.  **11200:** Skintag removal 1-15 Lesions (0.80 RVU)
    4.  **17000:** Destruction benign/pre-malignant Lesion 1 (Cryo) (0.61 RVU)
        **17003:** Destruction benign/pre-malignant Lesions 2-14 (Cryo) (0.04 RVU)
        * Use for Seborrheic Keratoses (SK) or Actinic Keratoses (AK).
* **Documentation:** Add to any office visit (incl. follow-ups, annuals) with 25 modifier (e.g., 99214 + 25 modifier + procedure code)[cite: 175].
* **Strategy:** Identify during PE, use smart phrase[cite: 176]. Significantly increases RVU/visit, takes minutes[cite: 177].

* **Other Common Procedures (depending on experience/comfort):** Injections (joint, trigger points), skin biopsies (extensive list), OMT[cite: 178]. wRVU vary (0.17 to 1.50)[cite: 179].
* **Recommendation:** Avoid time-intensive procedures or those with low reimbursement[cite: 180]. Seeing more patients might be more productive[cite: 181]. Conduct procedures during regular office visit to bill E&M + procedure[cite: 182]. Billing only procedure limits reaching 5.4 RVU/hour target[cite: 183].

**Office Procedure Billing Examples:**
* **Example 1 (Ear Pain + Cerumen):** 31yo M R ear pain x 1 wk[cite: 184, 185]. OTC meds no help[cite: 186]. Exam: wax build-up R ear[cite: 187]. Manually removed cerumen w/ curette[cite: 188]. R TM inflamed[cite: 188]. Dx: Otitis Media R, Otalgia R, Impacted Cerumen R[cite: 189, 190]. Rx: Augmentin[cite: 189]. Billing: 99214 + 25 modifier + 69210 (1.92 + 0.61 = 2.53 RVUs)[cite: 190].
* **Example 2 (Gout F/U + Skin Tags):** 58yo F gout f/u on Allopurinol 100mg, no flares[cite: 191]. C/o irritated neck skin tags (catch on clothes/jewelry)[cite: 192, 193]. Exam: 3 small tags R neck base[cite: 194]. Consent obtained, cleaned area, excised tags w/ sterile scissors[cite: 195]. Tolerated well, no bleeding/bandages[cite: 196]. Dx: Gout, Acrochordon[cite: 197]. Billing: 99213 + 25 modifier + 11200 (1.3 + 0.80 = 2.1 RVUs)[cite: 197].

---
## MEDICARE BILLING

* Medicare = ~25% total national health spending (>$1 trillion/yr)[cite: 199]. Significant portion of primary care panels, expected to grow[cite: 199].
* Constant funding cuts/adjustments yearly (CMS goal: budget neutrality) despite growing healthcare need[cite: 199].
* New add-on code (G2211) reflects complexity, slight reimbursement increase[cite: 199].
* Most PCPs know wellness visit codes, but many additional add-on codes exist to boost productivity[cite: 200].
* Medicare codes can be tagged onto regular visits or wellness visits, increasing wRVU[cite: 200].
* Focus on optimizing these codes to reach 5.4 RVU/hour target[cite: 201].

### NEW CODE G2211 (0.33 RVU) [cite: 206]

* Introduced Jan 2024 to recognize costs for primary/longitudinal care of Medicare pts[cite: 202].
* Added to outpatient office visits (99202-99215) for additional CMS payment[cite: 203, 205].
* Use if physician is focal point for care OR providing ongoing care for single serious/complex condition[cite: 204].
* Previously void with modifier 25[cite: 205]. **Beginning 2025:** can bill with modifier 25 services (Medicare Annual Exams, vaccine admin, Part B preventative services)[cite: 205].
* **Documentation:** Some orgs require phrase "I am managing a single, serious or complex condition for patient" in A/P[cite: 207].
* **Strategy:** Incorporate with most Medicare visits (most qualify) to increase productivity[cite: 208].

**G2211 Billing Examples:**
* **Example 1 (Chronic F/U):** 68yo M HTN/Hypothyroid f/u. BP controlled (120-130s)[cite: 210, 211]. Meds: Amlodipine 5mg, Lisinopril 10mg, Levo 75mcg. No SE[cite: 212, 213]. No concerns, labs UTD[cite: 214]. Dx: HTN, Hypothyroid[cite: 215]. Billing: 99214 + G2211 (1.92 + 0.33 = 2.25 RVUs)[cite: 215].
* **Example 2 (Chronic F/U + Procedure):** 75yo F DM/HLD f/u. Meds: Metformin 500mg BID, Rosuva 10mg. No SE[cite: 216]. C/o R ear hearing difficulty x 1 wk[cite: 217]. Exam: impacted cerumen R ear[cite: 218]. Consent obtained, manually removed wax, hearing improved[cite: 219]. Due for labs[cite: 220]. Dx: DM2 NIDDM, HLD, Impacted Cerumen R[cite: 220]. Billing: 99214 + 25 modifier + 69210 + G2211 (1.92 + 0.61 + 0.33 = 2.86 RVUs)[cite: 220].

---
### COMMON MEDICARE ADD ON CODES

* Many G-codes exist; focus on prioritized, higher probability codes[cite: 221].
* Covered by Medicare if used per guidelines (usually no pt out-of-pocket)[cite: 221].
* **Bolded codes** below are most likely encountered; familiarize requirements[cite: 221].
* Can bill G2211 with these add-ons to boost wRVU[cite: 222].

**Table 10: Common Medicare Add-On Codes & wRVUs** [cite: 224]
| Medicare Code | Description | Work RVU |
|---|---|---|
| G0442 | Annual Alcohol Misuse Screening | 0.18 |
| G0443 | Behavioral Counseling for Alcohol Misuse | 0.45 |
| **G0444** | **Annual Depression Screening** | **0.18** |
| G0445 | Behavioral Counseling to Prevent STI | 0.45 |
| **G0446** | **Intensive Behavioral Therapy for CVD** | **0.45** |
| **G0447** | **Behavioral Counseling for Obesity** | **0.45** |
| G0136 | Social Determinants of Health Risk Assessment Tool | 0.18 |
| **G0296** | **Counseling re: Need for Lung Cancer Screen (LDCT)** | **0.52** |
| **99497** | **Advance Care Planning (first 30 min)** | **1.5** |

#### G0444: Annual Depression Screening (0.18 RVU) [cite: 226]
* Use screening tool (e.g., PHQ9)[cite: 226].
* **Documentation:** Applies ONLY to Subsequent AWV (G0439)[cite: 227]. Must doc time spent (admin, interpret, doc, review w/ pt) > 7.5 mins[cite: 227, 228]. Applies to all Medicare pts[cite: 229]. Example: "PHQ9 today is ***. Total time spent...: 8 mins. Need for further intervention: ***"[cite: 229].
* **Limitation:** Bill once/year[cite: 230]. CANNOT use w/ G0402/G0438 (bundled)[cite: 230].
* **Strategy:** Bill with every eligible MAW. Usually in templates, just need to doc/bill[cite: 231].

#### G0446: Intensive Behavioral Therapy for CVD Risk Reduction (0.45 RVU) [cite: 232]
* Components:
    1.  Determine aspirin appropriateness (benefit > risk for men 45-79, women 55-79)[cite: 232].
    2.  Screen for high BP (vitals)[cite: 233].
    3.  Intensive counseling for healthy diet in adults w/ HLD, HTN, age, other risk factors[cite: 233].
* **Documentation:** Add to MAW or regular office visit[cite: 234]. Must doc time spent > 7.5 mins[cite: 235]. Applies to all Medicare pts[cite: 236]. Example: "BP screen done. USPSTF recs against low-dose aspirin initiation >60yo for primary ASCVD prevention discussed. Pt has CAD, cont Aspirin. Monitor BP, discussed exercise, nutrition, weight, Na restriction. Total time on intensive behavioral counseling...: ~8 mins"[cite: 236].
* **Limitation:** Use once/year[cite: 237].
* **Strategy:** Incorporate into MAW if time permits or first visit of year. Most pts have HTN/HLD/DM/CAD/obesity, counseling likely already happening[cite: 238].

#### G0447: Behavior Counseling for Obesity (0.45 RVU) [cite: 239]
* **Documentation:** Add to MAW or regular office visit[cite: 239]. Must doc time spent > 7.5 mins[cite: 240]. Applies to obese Medicare pts (BMI>30). List BMI in diagnosis[cite: 241]. Example: "Pt BMI ***. Discussed diet/exercise for BMI <25... (details on exercise, portions, calories)... Total time developing plan/counseling: ~8 mins"[cite: 242].
* **Limitation:** Can use 1x/wk (month 1), 1x/2wks (months 2-6), 1x/mo (months 7-12) - up to 21x/yr[cite: 243]. Unlikely used this often; easier to bill at all follow-ups[cite: 244].
* **Strategy:** >40% Medicare pts obese; maximize counseling at every visit to boost RVUs[cite: 245, 246].

#### G0296: Counseling for Lung Cancer Screening (LDCT) (0.52 RVU) [cite: 247]
* Eligibility:
    1.  Age 50-80, no current lung cancer signs/symptoms[cite: 247].
    2.  Smoking hx >= 20 pack-years[cite: 248].
    3.  Current smoker OR quit within last 15 years[cite: 249].
* **Documentation:** Add to MAW or regular office visit[cite: 250]. No time requirement[cite: 250]. Example: "Pt has *** pack year hx. Discussed need for LDCT. Counseled smoking risks. Info provided, order placed, pt will schedule"[cite: 251].
* **Limitation:** Use once/year[cite: 251].
* **Strategy:** Identify smokers (EMR flags help)[cite: 252]. Can also bill smoking cessation (99406/99407) same visit[cite: 252].

#### 99497: Advance Care Planning (First 30 mins) (1.5 RVU) [cite: 253]
* Voluntary, face-to-face discussion (pt, family, provider) re: healthcare wishes if pt unable to decide[cite: 253].
* Can be w/ or w/o completing legal forms (state specific)[cite: 254, 255]. Discussion topics: DNR, HCPOA, proxies, directives, living wills, MOLST[cite: 255].
* **Documentation:** Doc voluntariness, explanation of directives, who present, change in health status, pt wishes[cite: 256]. Must doc time > 16 mins[cite: 257]. Applies all Medicare pts[cite: 257]. Example: "We (*** and Dr. ***) discussed life saving measures. Pt has/has not AD (copy in chart). Choices: Full Code/DNR. Appointed *** HCR, backup ***. Dr. *** willing to follow wishes. POA received: ***. Spent ~16 mins face-to-face..."[cite: 258].
* **Limitation:** Can use once/year with G0438 or G0439[cite: 259].
* **Strategy:** Medicare pays if done same day as MAW. High RVU value, conduct whenever possible[cite: 260].

#### G0442/G0443: Annual Alcohol Misuse Screening/Counseling
* **G0442:** Screening (~15 mins) (0.18 RVU) [cite: 261]
* **G0443:** Counseling (~15 mins) (0.45 RVU) [cite: 261]
* **Documentation:** Add to MAW or regular visit[cite: 261]. Must doc time spent > 7.5 mins for each[cite: 262]. Use CAGE for screening[cite: 263]. Example (Screening): "CAGE questions asked... Total time screening...: 8 mins"[cite: 263].
* **Limitation:** Must screen (G0442) first, then counsel (G0443) on subsequent visit; cannot bill same day[cite: 264].
* **Strategy:** Only screen if time permits during MAW. Limited RVU, hard to track for subsequent counseling[cite: 265, 266].

#### G0445: Behavioral Counseling to Prevent STI (~15 mins) (0.45 RVU) [cite: 267]
* **Documentation:** Add to MAW or regular visit[cite: 267]. Must doc time spent > 7.5 mins[cite: 268]. Example: "Discussed latex condoms, proper use, avoiding sharing towels, wash pre/post intercourse, Hep B vax, HIV/STD testing, risks of substance abuse impairing safe sex, abstinence. Total time: 7.5 mins"[cite: 269, 270].
* **Limitation:** Limited use based on geography (higher rates in geriatric populations in some areas like Florida might increase use)[cite: 270].

#### G0136: Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) Risk Assessment Tool (5-15 mins) (0.18 RVU) [cite: 271]
* **Documentation:** Add to MAW or regular visit[cite: 271]. Must doc time spent (min 5 mins)[cite: 272]. SDOH = nonmedical factors influencing health (conditions where people born, grow, work, live, age)[cite: 273]. Issues usually brought up by patient (education, literacy, employment, social environment, etc.)[cite: 274]. Example: "Routine SDOH screen: housing insecurity: ***, food insecurity: ***, transportation: ***, utility difficulty: ***. Total time collecting/reviewing: 5 mins"[cite: 274].
* **Limitation:** Limited use (pt must initiate discussion)[cite: 275]. Limited wRVU potential for time spent[cite: 275].

---
## MEDICARE WELLNESS VISITS (MAW)

* Yearly check-up for Medicare pts: assess health status, update plan[cite: 277].
* Includes review of medical/family hx, meds, current status, risk factors (smoking, ETOH, mental health)[cite: 278]. Screenings (depression, obesity), cognitive assessment (dementia/Alzheimer's)[cite: 279]. Plan for future screenings (mammo, colonoscopy, immz), counseling, preventive services[cite: 280].
* Can be virtual[cite: 281]. Does NOT require PE or ROS (Welcome visit G0402 needs vision screen, but still not a physical)[cite: 282].
* EMR templates streamline encounters/documentation[cite: 283]. Institutions prioritize for Population Health Metrics[cite: 284].
* Significant wRVU opportunity: often split-billed, boosts productivity[cite: 285].

## TRANSITION CARE MANAGEMENT (TCM)

* Hospital discharge f/u visits within 7 or 14 days for Medicare pts (discharge day = day 1)[cite: 294].
* High RVU yield; prioritize these visits (even double-booking if needed)[cite: 294].
* Only need to discuss hospitalization care/subsequent evals/tx[cite: 294].
* Per AAFP: Can split-bill with E&M (25 modifier) if non-hospital related conditions also addressed[cite: 294].
* Requires documented interactive encounter (e.g., phone call by nurse) within 2 days post-discharge, prior to face-to-face visit[cite: 295].
* Per Medicare: Requires pt not be re-admitted within 30 days post-discharge[cite: 296]. Institutions often hold TCM charges for 30 days[cite: 297].
* If re-admitted <30 days, billing dept may switch TCM to office E&M (decreasing wRVU, often without notice)[cite: 297].

**Table 14: TCM Codes** [cite: 299]
| Code | Requirements | RVU |
|---|---|---|
| **99495** | - Phone call w/in 2 days post-discharge <br> - F/U visit w/in 14 days <br> - Moderate complexity MDM | 2.78 RVU |
| **99496** | - Phone call w/in 2 days post-discharge <br> - F/U visit w/in 7 days <br> - High complexity MDM | 3.79 RVU |

* **Documentation:** Plan section: "I have reviewed the hospital course, discharge summary along with all the labs and imaging from hospital stay"[cite: 298].
* **Strategy:**
    1.  If addressing non-hospital issues, split-bill w/ E&M (e.g., 99495 + 25 mod + 99213)[cite: 298].
    2.  Add counseling codes (obesity, smoking) on top of TCM code[cite: 298].

**TCM Billing Examples:**
* **Example 1 (Moderate Complexity + Split Bill):** 72yo M hospital f/u. Admitted cellulitis R leg, released 8 days prior[cite: 300, 301]. IV Abx/fluids in hospital[cite: 302]. LE US neg DVT[cite: 303]. Discharged on 5 days PO Abx (completed)[cite: 304]. Redness/swelling resolved[cite: 305]. Has DM, wants A1C check today[cite: 306]. Dx: Hosp Discharge F/U, Cellulitis LE, R Leg Swelling, DM2[cite: 307]. Billing: 99495 + 25 modifier + 99213 (2.78 + 1.3 = 4.08 RVUs)[cite: 307].
* **Example 2 (High Complexity + Counseling):** 67yo F hospital f/u. Admitted NSTEMI, PCI w/ 2 stents[cite: 308]. Discharged 3 days prior, starting cardiac rehab[cite: 309]. Meds: ASA, Plavix, Metoprolol, Atorva, Lisinopril (taking as directed)[cite: 310]. Still smokes 1 PPD[cite: 311]. Gained 15 lbs last 3 mo (BMI 33->37)[cite: 312]. Counseled smoking cessation (3 min) + obesity/weight (8 min)[cite: 312]. Dx: Hosp Discharge F/U, NSTEMI, CAD Native Artery, CAD s/p Stent, Nicotine Dep., Severe Obesity, BMI 37-37.9[cite: 313]. Billing: 99496 + 25 modifier + 99406 + G0447 (3.79 + 0.24 + 0.45 = 4.48 RVUs)[cite: 313].

## SAMPLE OF DAILY OFFICE SCHEDULE

* **Goal:** Maximize patient care, maintain efficiency[cite: 315]. Avg outpatient MD: 18-25 pts/day[cite: 316]. Balance visits, admin tasks, self-care[cite: 317]. Schedules vary (start/end times, hours, visit length, days worked)[cite: 318].
* **Example Structure:**
    * 8:00 AM – 12:00 PM: Patient Block (15 or 30 min appts)[cite: 319].
    * 12:00 PM – 1:00 PM: Lunch / Catch-up (in-basket, charting)[cite: 320].
    * 1:00 PM – 5:00 PM: Patient Block (15 or 30 min appts)[cite: 320].

**Table 15: Sample Daily Schedule Template (19 Patients)** [cite: 321]
| # | Time | Duration | # | Time | Duration |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 8:00-8:20am | 20 mins | 10 | 1:00-1:40pm | 40 mins |

## SAMPLE OF DAILY SCHEDULE (Analysis)

* Daily generation: 55.71 RVUs = 6.96 RVUs/hour (exceeds target 5.4 RVU/hr)[cite: 439].
* Based on national avg $45/wRVU, this day yielded >$2500 daily earnings[cite: 440].
* Extrapolated to 36 hr week -> >$11,000 weekly earnings from productivity (~$500k yearly)[cite: 441].
* **Factors Decreasing Productivity:** [cite: 442]
    * High patient no-shows/cancellations.
    * Large pediatric panel (fewer split-bill opportunities, well-child visits generate less RVU than 99214).
    * Prenatal care (paid globally end of pregnancy, visits = 0 RVU for most private insurance; Medicaid may have specific codes)[cite: 443]. Unless doing full pregnancy/delivery, referral to OB/Gyn may be better[cite: 444].
* **Factors Increasing Productivity:**
    * Large Medicare population (more MAW opportunities, G-code use)[cite: 445].
    * Double booking, smaller visit slots[cite: 446].
    * Scribes (in-person/virtual), smart phrases, templates[cite: 447].

## EXTRA

### SUMMARY

1.  Use accurate, up-to-date billing codes[cite: 449]. Review/improve coding to maximize reimbursement[cite: 450].
2.  Implement workflows for productivity (adequate pt numbers, capture risks)[cite: 451].
3.  Streamline documentation (smart phrases, AI, scribes) to reduce time on non-clinical tasks[cite: 452].
